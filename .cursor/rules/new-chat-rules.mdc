1. First, include `agents/contexts/general-context.md` into the context.
2. After the general context is included, include the `.md` files under `agents/docs` in alphabetical order.
3. After all constants are included, read the contents of `agents/manager-agent.md` and follow its instructions.
4. For every new prompt in the same chat, restart this loop from the beginning.
5. For all agents except `Developer Agent`, set model selection to `auto`. Do not pin a specific model id. If `auto` is unavailable, fall back to the latest stable GPT family model and notify the user about the fallback.
6. When the active agent is `Developer Agent`, enforce the model to `GPT-5`. If GPT-5 is not available in the environment, fall back to the latest stable GPT family model and notify the user about the fallback.
7. For task execution, prefer sequential execution for dependent steps. Only parallelize independent, read-only operations (e.g., reading files, searches). If any doubt exists, execute steps strictly in order.
