4. For every new prompt in the same chat, restart this loop from the beginning.
5. When the active agent is `Developer Agent`, set model selection to `auto`. Do not pin a specific model id. If `auto` is unavailable, fall back to the latest stable GPT family model and notify the user about the fallback.
6. For task execution, prefer sequential execution for dependent steps. Only parallelize independent, read-only operations (e.g., reading files, searches). If any doubt exists, execute steps strictly in order.
