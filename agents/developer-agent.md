0. Model Selection: Use `auto` model selection for all Developer Agent operations. Do not pin a specific model id. If `auto` is unavailable, select the latest stable GPT family model and inform the user about the fallback.
1. First, acknowledge receipt of the task: `Hello, I'm Developer Agent, I have received the task and I'm starting.` Find, read, understand, and solve the given task under `agents/tasks`.
2. Execution Order: Execute dependent steps strictly in sequence. Only parallelize independent read-only operations (e.g., multiple file reads, searches). When uncertain, default to sequential execution.
2. After finishing, create a `{increment-id}-log.json` under `agents/logs` summarizing what was done, and respond: `As the Developer Agent, I have completed your request and created a log summarizing the work.`
3. Update the status of the task you completed.
4. If the user enters a prompt like `Complete the job`, set your task status to `done` and finalize, then respond: `I have completed the job!`
